Exercise 5 — Stop Word Remover

Write a program that reads in a file of text, perhaps the text of a novel. The program copies the same text to an output file, except that all the useless words such as "the", "a", and "an" are removed. (Decide on what other words you with to remove. The list of words removed is called a stop list.) Do this by reading the text file token by token using hasNext() and next(), but only writing out tokens not on the stop list.

Prompt the user for the names of the input and output files.

Fairly Easy: The output file will have only N tokens per line. Do this by counting tokens as you output them. N will be something like 10 or 12.

Improved Program: Preserve the line structure of the input file. Do this by reading each line using nextLine() and then creating a new Scanner for that line. (Look at the on-line documentation for Scanner.) With each line's Scanner, use hasNext() and next() to scan through its tokens.

Harder: Write out no more than N characters per line. N will be something like 50. Do this by keeping count of the number of characters written out per line. The length() method of String will be useful. If X characters has already been written to the current line, and if X plus the length of the current token exceeds N, then start a new line.
